# OS-Simulator

The OS-Simulator project was built by a team of 10 students from NITK, Surathkal, in partial fulfilment of the Operating Systems course (CS252) offered by the CSE Department of the institute.

The simulator implements the following features:
1. System Calls
2. Process Scheduling Algorithms
3. Disk Scheduling Algorithms
4. Memory Allocation Algorithms
5. File Allocation Methods
6. Page Replacement Algorithms
7. Banker's Algorithm for Deadlock Avoidance
8. Deadlock Detection using Resource Allocation Graph

In supplement to the above features, the following acccessories are also present:
1. Wiki pages, which have documentation for the 8 features listed above.
2. Terminal, which provides a similar interface as the Linux Terminal or Windows Command Prompt.
3. Team section, which contains the list of the members who have contributed to this project.
