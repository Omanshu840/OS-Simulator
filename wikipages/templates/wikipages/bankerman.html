            <p>The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by
                simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an
                “s-state” check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to
                continue.</p>

            <p><strong>Banker’s algorithm is named so?</strong></p>
            <p>
                Banker’s algorithm is named so because it is used in banking system to check whether loan can be
                sanctioned
                to a person or not. Suppose there are n number of account holders in a bank and the total sum of their
                money
                is S. If a person applies for a loan then the bank first subtracts the loan amount from the total money
                that
                bank has and if the remaining amount is greater than S then only the loan is sanctioned. It is done
                because
                if all the account holders comes to withdraw their money then the bank can easily do it.
            </p>
            <p>
                In other words, the bank would never allocate its money in such a way that it can no longer satisfy the
                needs of all its customers. The bank would try to be in safe state always.
            </p>

                Banker’s Algorithm:</h4>

            <p>Let ‘n’ be the number of processes in the system and ‘m’ be the number of resources types.</p>

            <p><strong>Available :</strong></p>

            <p>It is a 1-d array of size ‘m’ indicating the number of available resources of each type.</p>
            <p>Available[ j ] = k means there are ‘k’ instances of resource type Rj</p>

            <p><strong>Max :</strong></p>

            <p>It is a 2-d array of size ‘n*m’ that defines the maximum demand of each process in a system.</p>
            <p>Max[ i, j ] = k means process Pi may request at most ‘k’ instances of resource type Rj.</p>

            <p><strong>Allocation :</strong></p>

            <p>It is a 2-d array of size ‘n*m’ that defines the number of resources of each type currently allocated to
                each process.</p>
            <p>Allocation[ i, j ] = k means process Pi is currently allocated ‘k’ instances of resource type Rj</p>

            <p><strong>Need :</strong></p>

            <p>It is a 2-d array of size ‘n*m’ that indicates the remaining resource need of each process.</p>
            <p>Need [ i, j ] = k means process Pi currently need ‘k’ instances of resource type Rj
                for its execution.</p>

            <p>Need [ i, j ] = Max [ i, j ] – Allocation [ i, j ]</p>

            <p>Allocationi specifies the resources currently allocated to process Pi and Needi specifies the additional
                resources that process Pi may still request to complete its task.</p>

            <h4>Safety Algorithm</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">1.Let Work and Finish be vectors of length m and n, respectively. Initially, <br>
                -------------------------------------<br>
                <code>Work = Available<br>
                                    Finish[i] =false for i = 0, 1, ... , n - 1.<br></code>
                -------------------------------------<br>
                This means, initially, no process has finished and the number of available resources is represented by
                the Available array.<br>
                2.Find an index i such that both<br>
                -------------------------------------<br>
                <code>Finish[i] ==false<br>
                                    Need(i) <= Work<br></code>
                -------------------------------------<br>
                If there is no such i present, then proceed to step 4.<br>
                It means, we need to find an unfinished process whose need can be satisfied by the available resources.
                If no such process exists, just go to step 4.<br>
                3.Perform the following: <br>
                -------------------------------------<br>
                <code>Work = Work + Allocation;<br>
                                    Finish[i] = true;<br></code>
                -------------------------------------<br>
                Go to step 2.<br>
                When an unfinished process is found, then the resources are allocated and the process is marked
                finished. And then, the loop is repeated to check the same for all other processes.<br>
                4.If Finish[i] == true for all i, then the system is in a safe state.<br>
                That means if all processes are finished, then the system is in safe state.</p>
            <h4>Resource Request Algorithm</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">1.If number of requested instances of each resource is less than the need (which was
                declared previously by the process), go to step 2.<br>
                2.If number of requested instances of each resource type is less than the available resources of each
                type, go to step 3. If not, the process has to wait because sufficient resources are not available
                yet.<br>
                3.Now, assume that the resources have been allocated. Accordingly do,<br>
                -------------------------------------<br>
                <code>Available = Available - Request(i)<br>
                                    Allocation(i) = Allocation(i) + Request(i)<br>
                                    Need(i) = Need(i) - Request(i)<br></code>
